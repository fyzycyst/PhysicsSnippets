# Physics Snippets

A collection of physics-based examples and visualizations implemented in Julia. These examples are designed to be both educational and visually engaging, making them suitable for physicists learning Julia or anyone interested in computational physics.

## Examples

### 1. Monte Carlo Pi Estimation
- **Description**: Estimates Ï€ using the Monte Carlo method by randomly sampling points in a square and counting those that fall within an inscribed circle.
- **Files**:
  - `monte_carlo_pi.jl`: Basic implementation with visualization
  - `monte_carlo_pi_convergence.jl`: Analysis of convergence and performance

## Requirements

- Julia 1.6 or higher
- Required packages:
  - CairoMakie
  - Random
  - Statistics

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fyzycyst/PhysicsSnippets.git
cd PhysicsSnippets
```

2. Install required packages:
```julia
julia --project -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.instantiate()'
```

## Usage

Each example can be run directly with Julia. For example:
```bash
julia monte_carlo_pi.jl
```
